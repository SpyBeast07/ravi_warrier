        <h2 class="section-title">A Strategy Guide for Founders Who Operate in Chaos</h2>

        <p class="about-summary-desc">
            I wanted to take a moment to share with you three quotes that have guided me through life, and explain why
            they matter so much to me:
            <br>
            <br>
            The first is, <span class="text-color">“Nothing is permanent, and everything changes.”</span>
            This one's simple but true. Life is full of ups and downs, and nothing stays the same forever—whether it's
            success, failure, or anything in between. It reminds me to stay steady through it all, knowing that every
            moment is temporary.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second is, <span class="text-color">“How you do anything is how you do everything.”</span>
            This one is all about the quality of your work. I've learned that quality doesn't happen by accident—it
            comes from discipline, knowledge, and a conscious effort to do your best now and better the next time.
            Whether it's a big project or a small task, the care and effort you put into it reflect how you approach
            everything in life. That's why I always strive to give my best in everything I do.
            <br>
            <br>
            And the third is by Lily Tomlin: <span class="text-color">“The trouble with the rat race is that even if you
                win, you're still a rat.”</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            This one hit me hard when I first heard it. It's a good reminder that chasing after things just because
            society says you should—money, status, whatever—can still leave you feeling empty. I've always tried to make
            sure that what I'm working towards actually matters to me, not just what looks good on paper.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I was 17, I started my first business, and I learned quickly that treating customers well can set you
            apart. I made a lot of mistakes, but what stuck with me was that <span class="text-color">making people
                happy through good service</span> really mattered.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I continued building businesses, I learned that <span class="text-color">creating real value for
                customers was more important than anything else.</span> It's easy to get caught up in trying to make
            your business look good on the outside, but what really matters is solving problems and creating things that
            genuinely help people.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've done a lot of different things in my life—worked as a waiter, bartender, delivery boy, accountant,
            coder, project manager, consultant, coach, and many other roles. What all of those jobs taught me was not
            just about business, but about people. And about myself. Over time, I realized that <span
                class="text-color">I love solving problems, and I enjoy helping others figure out how to do the
                same.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            That's why I started <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://fundingpitchcraft.com/">Funding
                Pitchcraft</a> in 2023. It's my way of working with startup founders to help them improve their investor
            interactions. I get to bring together everything I've learned—creativity, problem-solving, and understanding
            people—and use it to make a difference.
            <br>
            <br>
            More recently, I wrote a book called A Startup Founder's Guide to the Art of War, which takes lessons from
            Sun Tzŭ's classic and adapts them for startup founders trying to survive and thrive in today's world. If
            you're interested, you can always find and drop me a note on mastadon social (<a class="links"
                target="_blank" href="https://mastodon.social/@raviwarrier">@raviwarrier</a>). That's the best way to
            reach me directly.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, before I wrap up, let me say this: those three quotes I mentioned at the start? They've guided me, and I
            believe that having a guiding idea or philosophy can really shape the way you live and work. Maybe one of
            these quotes resonates with you. Or maybe you have one of your own. Either way, I think it's worth holding
            on to something that helps you stay grounded.
            <br>
            <br>

            After decades working with founders, I learned that failure rarely comes from lack of talent.

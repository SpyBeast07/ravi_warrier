        ABOUT — STORY CONTENT
    ============================ -->
    <section class="about-story container">

        <p>
            You're not just a founder; you're a strategist navigating chaos. I'm Ravi Warrier, and my mission is to
            translate
            timeless strategic principles into actionable systems for founders like you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not a guru. I'm a founder-educator who spent decades learning what separates startups that scale from
            those
            that collapse under their own ambition. My work sits at the intersection of ancient strategy and modern
            execution
            science—blending Sun Tzu’s military wisdom with the operating principles used by elite companies today.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey began with a deep fascination for <em>The Art of War</em> — not as ancient history, but as a
            living
            framework for competitive advantage. The same principles that shaped wars 2,500 years ago still shape
            markets
            today. Over the years, I realized that founders don’t fail because of talent or effort. They fail because
            they are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>solving the wrong problems</li>
            <li>in the wrong order</li>
            <li>using the wrong frameworks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Strategy</strong> is about seeing terrain others miss and making moves that create asymmetric
            advantage.<br>
            <strong>Design</strong> is about shaping business models and go-to-market motion before writing a line of
            code.<br>
            <strong>Execution</strong> is where most teams collapse—clarity without cadence becomes theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            I spent the better part of two decades working with founders who operate under impossible constraints.
            Through
            this work emerged <strong>The Founder’s Trilogy</strong>—a complete operating system from strategy → design
            →
            execution. Every principle and template is tested with real founders navigating real complexity.
        </p>

        <p>Today, my work extends across:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Authoring The Founder’s Trilogy</li>
            <li>Educating at IIM Bangalore’s NSRCEL and startup ecosystems across India</li>
            <li>Mentoring post-pivot and scaling-stage founders</li>
            <li>Building decision frameworks that replace instinct with systems</li>
            <li>Translating strategic intent into operating cadences</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I support founders through three formats:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Assessment</strong> — uncover blind spots in strategy, design, & execution</li>
            <li><strong>The Community</strong> — practice with peers</li>
            <li><strong>Speaking & Workshops</strong> — bring systems to your team</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            My work isn’t about writing books. It’s about helping you build the clarity, discipline, and operating
            rhythm
            required to win your market—systematically, not accidentally.

        THE PHILOSOPHY
    ============================ -->
    <section class="philosophy container card">
        <h2>The Philosophy</h2>

        <p><strong>Strategy is worthless without execution.</strong> Too many founders have brilliant strategies that
            die in the
            chaos of daily operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Execution is impossible without systems.</strong> You can't will yourself to better execution. You
            need
            frameworks, rituals, and rhythms.</p>

        <p><strong>Systems scale, heroics don't.</strong> The goal isn't to work harder. It's to install an operating
            system that
            runs whether you're in the room or not.</p>
